## Organization Overview

### Mission
We create hands-on projects that bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical engineering, making advanced robotics and IoT technology accessible to hobbyists, students, and early-career engineers.

### Focus Areas
- **Arduino & Microcontroller Programming** – Low-level embedded systems development in C/C++ and MicroPython
- **IoT & Sensor Integration** – Multi-sensor systems with wireless connectivity (Bluetooth, nRF24L01)
- **Hardware-Software Integration** – End-to-end system design from circuit to code
- **RC Vehicles ** – Motor control, PWM, and Mecanum wheel kinematics
- **Real-time Debugging & Testing** – Serial monitoring, hardware validation, and iterative prototyping
- **Autonomous Systems** – Robots and vehicles that perceive, decide, and act independently
- **GAME DEVELOPMENT** – creating and educating students to make games in order to learn techie skills
